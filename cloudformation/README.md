# cloudformation template

This template is a work in progress and DOES NOT currently work.  It is based on the ElasticBeanstalk Worker Environment sample app.

Everything seems to work correctly but for some reason it never gets beyond "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS".  The event log seems to match the ElasticBeanstalk sample app creation event log as a comparison -- except the final success.  Help and PR welcome.
